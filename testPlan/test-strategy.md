# Test Strategy for Next.js Todo Application

## Overview

This document outlines the test strategy for the Next.js Todo application, detailing the approach to ensuring quality through automated testing of both UI and API components.

## What is Being Tested

The Next.js Todo application is being tested across multiple layers:

1. **User Interface (UI) Layer**

    - Login functionality
    - Todo management interface (create, read, update, delete operations)
    - Form validations and error handling
    - Navigation between pages

2. **API Layer**

    - Authentication endpoints
    - Todo CRUD operation endpoints
    - Error handling and edge cases
    - API response structure and status codes

3. **Integration**
    - End-to-end workflows combining UI interactions and API calls
    - Data consistency across UI and API layers

## Test Coverage Areas

### UI Test Coverage

-   **Authentication**

    -   Login form display and validation
    -   Successful login flow
    -   Error handling for invalid credentials
    -   Navigation to registration page

-   **Todo Management**
    -   Todo list display
    -   Adding new todos
    -   Marking todos as complete/incomplete
    -   Editing existing todos
    -   Deleting todos
    -   Empty state handling

### API Test Coverage

-   **Authentication API**

    -   Successful login with valid credentials
    -   Rejection of invalid credentials
    -   Input validation
    -   Token generation and authentication

-   **Todo API**
    -   Retrieving all todos
    -   Creating new todos
    -   Retrieving specific todos by ID
    -   Updating todo status and content
    -   Deleting todos
    -   Error handling for invalid requests

### Workflow Testing

-   Complete user journeys from login to logout
-   Todo lifecycle management (create → read → update → delete)
-   Error recovery flows
-   Batch operations

## Tools Used

### Primary Testing Framework

**Playwright**: Selected for its robust capabilities in automating both UI and API testing within a single framework.

Benefits:

-   Cross-browser testing support
-   Auto-wait functionality that reduces flakiness
-   Network interception capabilities
-   Powerful selector engine
-   Excellent debugging tools
-   Support for both UI and API testing in one framework

### Supporting Technologies

1. **Next.js**: The application framework being tested
2. **Jest**: Used for assertions in conjunction with Playwright
3. **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD integration (if applicable)
4. **Playwright Test Reports**: For visualizing test results

## How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 20.x
-   pnpm 10.x
-   Project dependencies installed via `pnpm install`

### Running UI Tests

Run all UI tests:

```bash
pnpm playwright:test tests/ui/
```

Run specific UI test files:

```bash
pnpm playwright:test tests/ui/login.test.ts
pnpm playwright:test tests/ui/todos.test.ts
```

### Running API Tests

Run all API tests:

```bash
pnpm playwright:test tests/api/
```

Run specific API test files:

```bash
pnpm playwright:test tests/api/login.test.ts
pnpm playwright:test tests/api/items.test.ts
pnpm playwright:test tests/api/workflow.test.ts
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
pnpm playwright:test
```

### Viewing Test Reports

After tests complete, view the HTML report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

1. Tests assume a stable development environment with consistent data
2. Test user credentials remain constant (test@example.com/password123)
3. The application is run locally for testing
4. Tests are executed in a controlled environment without network latency issues

### Limitations

1. **Test Data Management**: The tests rely on in-memory data store rather than a persistent database
2. **Environment Constraints**: Tests are designed for local execution and may require adjustment for CI environments
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Current tests focus on happy paths and common error scenarios, but don't cover all edge cases
4. **Performance Testing**: The current test suite doesn't include performance or load testing
5. **Visual Testing**: No pixel-perfect visual regression testing is implemented

## Future Improvements

1. Implement visual regression testing
2. Add accessibility testing components
3. Expand test coverage for edge cases
4. Implement data-driven testing for more robust coverage
5. Add performance testing benchmarks
